[[./share/images/screenshot.png]]
*Noteditor* is an open-source, all-in-one window manager and text editor designed to streamline your development experience.
Powered by *Emacs* and on the foundation of *FG42*, and *EXWM*.

** Requirements
- Emacs >= 27.1
- texinfo
- fd
- silversearcher-ag
- nodejs


** Install from source
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Install emacs, make and texinfo
# clone the noteditor repository.
$ git clone git@github.com:yottanami/noteditor.git ~/.noteditor/
# You can clone it where ever your want
$ cd ~/.noteditor/
$ make install
$ noteditor
#+END_SRC

** Configuration
*** User configuration file
Create ~/.noteditor/config.el and set your preferences. Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq noteditor-mode 'editor)  ;; or 'wm
(setq noteditor-terminal "alacritty")
(setq noteditor-browser "brave-browser")
(setq noteditor-media-player nil)
(setq noteditor-screen-lock nil)
(setq noteditor-project-search-path '("~/src/" "~/work/"))
(setq noteditor-aidermacs-default-model "openrouter/openai/gpt-5")
(setq noteditor-supported-languages '(nix typescript svelte java python yaml))

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq noteditor-mode 'editor)       ;; or 'wm
(setq noteditor-terminal "alacritty")
(setq noteditor-browser "brave-browser")
(setq noteditor-project-search-path '("~/src/" "~/work/"))
